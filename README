VS1053B MP3 Decoder library for Arduino.

This is based on sample code form http://www.sparkfun.com.

The MP3 shield used is the original Sparkfun MP3 shield that appears to be no longer available. It has been replaced by one with a builtin micro SD card slot.
This library has only been tested with the original shield.

This library is supplied as-is with no warranty that it will work with your shield.

The code is still a work-in-progress and is available here for testing.
